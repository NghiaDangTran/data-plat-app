Dear Dr. Sylvain Charlebois,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you of a ssmall issue I have recently discovered in our platform's codebase. It appears there is a bug that causes the system to collect only a small set of data from a search query. Consequently, the platform is currently gathering approximately only one-tenth of the available data from our sourced websites. I am actively working on resolving this issue. However, I wanted to preemptively notify you that, over the next few days, you might experience some irregularities or errors while using the platform's website.


Best regards,
Nghia Dang
